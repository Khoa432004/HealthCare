## Testing the New APIs

After setup, you can test the 2-step registration:

### Step 1: Personal Info
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/api/auth/register/personal-info \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "fullName": "Test Doctor",
    "phone": "0999888777",
    "identityCard": "999888777666",
    "dateOfBirth": "1990-01-01",
    "gender": "MALE",
    "address": "Test Address",
    "country": "Vietnam",
    "state": "Ho Chi Minh City",
    "city": "District 1",
    "zipCode": "700000",
    "addressLine1": "123 Test Street",
    "addressLine2": "Test Building"
  }'
```

### Step 2: Professional Info
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/api/auth/register/professional-info \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "userId": 1,
    "username": "test_doctor",
    "email": "test@doctor.com",
    "password": "password123",
    "title": "DOCTOR",
    "currentProvince": "Ho Chi Minh City",
    "clinicHospital": "Test Hospital",
    "careForAdults": true,
    "careForChildren": false,
    "specialties": ["CARDIOLOGY"],
    "treatmentConditions": ["HYPERTENSION"],
    "languages": ["VIETNAMESE", "ENGLISH"],
    "department": "Cardiology"
  }'
```

## Troubleshooting

### If you get foreign key errors:
- Make sure to run the scripts in order
- Check that all referenced IDs exist

### If you get sequence errors:
- The reset script should handle this
- Manually reset: `ALTER SEQUENCE table_id_seq RESTART WITH 1;`

### If you need to check data:
```sql
-- Check sample data
SELECT * FROM roles;
SELECT username, email, title FROM accounts;
SELECT full_name, phone, department FROM users;
```
